Alright Im a human being A being Happy and sane Oh but human beings We all need to quit Being inhumane Chorus Yea I dont want to say Im right I just want you to know I dont want to say Im right I just want you to know I a reputation For replacing My confidence with fear But all the untimely embracing Love that I have found to be sincere Chorus To know that there was a man Who lived. To know that There was a man who lived one day With holes in his hands as some do say And I believe wed be friends if we talked and prayed So we do thats why we do. The phrase itself is polite enough but it is often used in situations where the speaker is being impolite by making the comment such as correcting a stranger on some trivial mistake. I made a mistake with the lyrics somewhere towards the end of the song.</p>

And Id give up forever to touch you Cuz I know that you feel me somehow Youre the closest to heaven that Ill ever be And I dont want to go home right now And all I can taste is this moment And all I can breathe is your life Cuz sooner or later its over I just dont want to miss you tonight And I dont want the world to see me Cuz I dont think that theyd understand When everythings made. I just want you to know I just want you to know. So many problems can be prevented by taking timely action.
